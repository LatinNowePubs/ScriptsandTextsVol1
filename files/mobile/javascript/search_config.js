Since the wife of Cerialis had been identified            as Lepidina, the editors returned to this fragment and realised that            it was in fact part of a leaf containing the foot of the right-hand            column of a letter to Cerialis and revised the reading to Lepidinam            tuam a me saluta ‘greet your Lepidina from me’ (Bowman and            Thomas 1994). The editors noted that: ‘The evidence relating to            Cerialis’ wife Lepidina and the pattern of expression in 291 and            244 make it clear that the reading of line 1 in the ed. pr. was wide            of the mark’.

The ink traces had been  preserved for about two thousand years, but once the first finds were  dug out from their anaerobic conditions and opened, the ink was  visible for about fifteen minutes before it faded in the air (Birley 1977,  134). A way of conserving the subsequent finds of wooden tablets  and their ink traces was developed at Vindolanda. The best way to  read these tablets was found to be through infra-red technology:  Robin Birley used infra-red equipment from a local police station  when the first Vindolanda tablets were recovered (Blackshaw 1974;   Fig. 45: The early second-century letter of Octavius to Candidus found  Bowman and Thomas 1983) and later the Vindolanda team worked   at Vindolanda (Tab. Vindol. 343).

We have a large, and increasing, number and they            often illuminate areas about which the literary sources are quiet.            Through them we can access different strata of society and find out            about the economics, politics, administration, social dynamics and            lived experience in Rome and its provinces. It is not just the explicit            content which can help us: subtle sociolinguistic and palaeographical            analysis can shed light on educational practices, linguistic contacts            and identities. As our sets of handwritten documents grow, we can            more accurately understand the development of the types of scripts            (bookhands, ORC, NRC) and their likely dating can be refined,            which in turn will help us to date, with caution, collections whose               Fig. 48: An RTI Dome being used to study a lead curse tablet from Roman            dating cannot be fixed by other means.

In the coming decades we hope            to have more finds and publications of (ethically sourced) texts            written in NRC, since our existing coverage is very patchy.             One exciting area for the future is the continued development of            techniques for reading texts which are not visible, for example            inside rolled up scrolls or tablets, or only partially visible to the            naked eye, for example stylus tablets.  For carbonised rolls, current            techniques include refining a combination of machine learning and            X-ray phase-contrast tomography which can pick up the differences            in signal between carbonised scroll and ink and analyse them. The            technique is revolutionary because it allows scientists to study the            fragile rolls without trying to unroll them.

Next steps  contain valuable new literature from the ancient world, perhaps             including Latin texts in bookhands and cursive.   ‘Everyday’ textual sources are essential for our understanding of the  Roman world. We have a large, and increasing, number and they  often illuminate areas about which the literary sources are quiet.  Through them we can access different strata of society and find out  about the economics, politics, administration, social dynamics and  lived experience in Rome and its provinces. It is not just the explicit  content which can help us: subtle sociolinguistic and palaeographical  analysis can shed light on educational practices, linguistic contacts  and identities. As our sets of handwritten documents grow, we can  more accurately understand the development of the types of scripts  (bookhands, ORC, NRC) and their likely dating can be refined,  which in turn will help us to date, with caution, collections whose   Fig. 48: An RTI Dome being used to study a lead curse tablet from Roman  dating cannot be fixed by other means.

In the coming decades we hope  to have more finds and publications of (ethically sourced) texts  written in NRC, since our existing coverage is very patchy.   One exciting area for the future is the continued development of  techniques for reading texts which are not visible, for example  inside rolled up scrolls or tablets, or only partially visible to the  naked eye, for example stylus tablets.  For carbonised rolls, current  techniques include refining a combination of machine learning and  X-ray phase-contrast tomography which can pick up the differences  in signal between carbonised scroll and ink and analyse them. The  technique is revolutionary because it allows scientists to study the  fragile rolls without trying to unroll them.
